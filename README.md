# BPR Bank Loan Origination Process Re-engineering

This project aims to streamline the loan origination process at BPR Bank by addressing customer dissatisfaction and financial losses stemming from lengthy application processing times. By implementing business process re-engineering, we target faster application approvals, improved customer satisfaction, and a reduced financial impact from abandoned applications.

## Project Scope

The project involves re-engineering the loan origination process within the BPR Bank's Management Information System (MIS) to reduce application processing times and improve the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI). The specific objectives are:

- **Reduce Average Time Between Loan Application and Funding (ATBLA)** to 2 hours.
- **Increase CSI** to 80% by enhancing process efficiency and customer experience.

## Current vs. Future State

### Current State (Before Re-engineering)

The current state process faces delays and customer dissatisfaction due to its manual, lengthy, and inefficient steps. Below is a summary of the workflow with associated entities:

1. **Customers** submit **Loan Applications** at **Branches**.
2. **Loan Officers** manually handle **Application Processing** and check initial documents.
3. **Credit Checks** are conducted by the Credit Reference Bureau, with results returned to the loan officer.
4. **Quality Control Team** verifies application compliance, adding to delays.
5. **Branch Managers** make final **Loan** decisions, impacting approval speed.
6. Approved applications are manually logged into the **IT System** and notifications are sent to customers.
7. **Feedback/CSI Scores** indicate low customer satisfaction due to prolonged processing times.
8. **Financial Losses** accumulate from abandoned applications due to excessive delays.

This process is marked by manual interventions, multiple decision points, and prolonged approval times, leading to customer frustration and a yearly financial loss of approximately Rwf 40,000,000.

### Future State (After Re-engineering)

The re-engineered process introduces automation and streamlined workflows to achieve faster processing times, higher customer satisfaction, and reduced financial losses. Key changes include:

1. **Customers** submit **Loan Applications** digitally or at **Branches**, with automated data entry.
2. The **IT System** performs **Automated Application Processing**, including real-time checks and notifications for missing items.
3. Integrated **Instant Credit Checks** reduce waiting times and automatically evaluate results.
4. **Automated Quality Control** compliance checks minimize manual interventions.
5. **Branch Managers** or the system grant quick approvals on standard **Loans**.
6. **Instant Customer Notifications and Funding** are enabled, with a goal of reducing approval-to-funding time to 2 hours.
7. **Feedback/CSI Scores** improve as the streamlined process enhances customer satisfaction and reduces abandoned applications.
8. **Financial Losses** are minimized due to improved processing times and better customer retention.

This new workflow eliminates many manual steps, enhances efficiency, and aligns with the MIS framework to support decision-making and organizational goals.
